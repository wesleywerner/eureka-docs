Eureka .ugh Configuration Reference
===================================

Eureka Editor enables game and source port editing configuration by reading from ``.ugh`` extension files. For the base
games and supported source ports, Eureka comes installed with ``.ugh`` files under the ``common``, ``games`` and
``ports`` subfolders. ``common`` is with various data shared by multiple games (think for example of Doom and Doom 2),
``games`` is for the base game specific information, and the files are typically named after the IWADs (e.g.
``doom.wad``, ``doom2.wad`` have the ``doom.ugh``, ``doom2.ugh`` corresponding files), and ``ports`` is for the
enhancements added by various supported source ports.
